Create SSH keys with different names

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_name@email.com"
When you see this message

Generating public/private rsa key pair. 
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user_name/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter unique name, for example:

id_rsa_home
Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase.

So, you'll have created SSH key for your home account, now you can generate SSH key for your company account.

Call SSH key generator again with second mail.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_name@company_email.com"
Enter name for file

id_rsa_company
After all steps you can check that all keys were created.

$ ls ~/.ssh
You should see a similar files list:

id_rsa_home  id_rsa_company  id_rsa_home.pub  id_rsa_company.pub
Now you need a config file for organise these keys.

$ cd ~/.ssh/
$ touch config
$ nano config
Add into config file:

# Home
Host gitlab-home
  HostName gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_home

# Company account
Host company.github.com
  HostName github.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company
Next you'll delete cached keys

$ ssh-add -D
If you see a message

Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
Then enter:

eval `ssh-agent -s`
and try again previous command.

Next, you can check that your keys were added:

$ ssh-add -l
2048 d4:e0:39:e1:bf:6f:e3:26:14:6b:26:73:4e:b4:53:83 /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa_home (RSA)
2048 7a:32:06:3f:3d:6c:f4:a1:d4:65:13:64:a4:ed:1d:63 /home/mateusz/.ssh/id_rsa_company (RSA)
If you haven't any entries then you should add your keys

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_company
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_home
Now you can check connection

$ ssh -T git@home.github.com
Hi home_user! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

$ ssh -T git@work.github.com
Hi company_user! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY EXISTING PROJECT THEN UPDATE GIT URL
git remote set-url origin git@gitlab-home:your_git_project_clone_url.git
